A small project using @OpenWeatherApi to display the user weather condition, acessing the user location with geolocation if allowed, if not displaying a fixed location in this case 'San Francisco'.

It get the user city, the weather conditions & weather degrees. The user is allowed to change from Fahrenheit to Celsius by clicking  in the degree and it will automaticly converting back and forth to Fahrenheit/Celsius.

Also have icon giving by WeatherApi according to weather condition && background color ajusting according to the weather condition.

Then, i used another api @MapQuest to get a small 'map' to display the user position and display it below the city name.
